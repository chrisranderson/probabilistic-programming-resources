# probabilistic programming resources
Things I've found useful for learning probabilistic programming.

### Online books
[Probabilistic Models of Cognition](https://probmods.org/index.html): a really nice book that teaches you how to think using a PPL called Church. Complete with lots of interactive code examples and exercises. [Church sandbox](https://probmods.org/play-space.html) and [language reference](https://probmods.org/webchurch/online/ref.html).

[Probabilistic Programming and Bayesian Methods for Hackers](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/CamDavidsonPilon/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers/blob/master/Prologue/Prologue.ipynb).


### Languages
[Stan](http://mc-stan.org/documentation/): I found it pretty easy to get up and running using their Python interface. Their reference is quite extensive. Lots of examples. Write models in Stan which compile to C++.

[Anglican](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~fwood/anglican/language/index.html): a subset of Clojure, from Oxford.

[WebPPL](http://webppl.org/): PPL embedded in JavaScript.

[PyMC3](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc3): a Python module for Bayesian statistical modeling.

### Courses
[Probabilistic graphical models](https://www.coursera.org/course/pgm): a course by Daphne Koller on PGMs, with tons of videos, quizzes, etc.

### Videos
[Pystan: Bayesian Inference for Fun and Profit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjiLOTRwpfY&t=705s): a nice demo of [Stan](http://mc-stan.org/documentation/).

### Misc
[Comparison of distributions](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/7myexs3gzw): an interactive comparison of probability distributions on [Desmos](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/7myexs3gzw).
