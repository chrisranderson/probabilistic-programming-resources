# probabilistic programming resources
Things I've found useful for learning probabilistic programming.

[Probabilistic Programming and Bayesian Methods for Hackers](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/CamDavidsonPilon/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers/blob/master/Prologue/Prologue.ipynb).

[Probabilistic Models of Cognition](https://probmods.org/index.html): a really nice book (or something like that) that teaches you how to think using a PPL called Church. Complete with lots of interactive code examples and exercises. [Church sandbox](https://probmods.org/play-space.html) and [language reference](https://probmods.org/webchurch/online/ref.html).

[Stan](http://mc-stan.org/documentation/): a PPL that I found pretty easy to get up and running using their Python interface. Their reference is quite extensive. Lots of examples.
